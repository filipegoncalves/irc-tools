# irc-tools

A set of IRC bots acting as a server to provide security services for an IRC network. The idea is to have it complement regular IRC services.

## Project status
This is under heavy development and absolutely not ready for real IRC networks, and it will take a while to be. This is more like a playground / toy project for me to get acquainted with Rust and the IRC protocol
